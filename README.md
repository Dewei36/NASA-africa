# NASA-africa

This is a part of EC601 project in which we have planned to build a website which would display information on the different crops which can be favourly grown in different regions of africa. We have planned to use the dataset available from kaggle african soil competition to train the machine learning model we are building. The predicted results will be mapped onto the list of crops which inturn will be mapped to the website.

Mahcine learning algorithms we are going to implement:
1)Linear regression
2)Random Forest
3)Support Vecotor Machines
